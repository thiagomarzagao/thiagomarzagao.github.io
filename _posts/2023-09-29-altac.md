title: non-academic careers for quant PhDs
---

This just came out and I wrote one of the chapters. The book is meant for people who did math-heavy PhDs and are considering non-academic careers. It should help them realize that if they know what a p-value is then they can do a lot more than please journal editors and teach bored undergrads; they can use their quant skills to have impact in the real world (and make a lot more money than their academic counterparts). If you check it out let me know what you think.
