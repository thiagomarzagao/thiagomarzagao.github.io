That can wrong in massive ways. People without statistical training shouldn't mess with anything beyond plots and maybe correlation.<br/><br/>But it gets worse. In chapter 17 Hubbard goes completely insane:<br/><br/><quote>I also sometimes find that a variable is a better fit if I use even more elaborate rules. Perhaps the correlation with a variable is best with its logarithm, with its inverse, or by making part of a product of other variables. Experimentation is encouraged. I generally try several versions of nonlinear variables on the same data, and I usually find one version that stands out as a clear winner.</quote><br/><br/>Dude...<br/><br/>The first few chapters are good though.

The KGB could then have launched an immediate manhunt, stripped Gordievsky’s flat for clues to his whereabouts, pulled in for questioning every friend and relative, redoubled surveillance of British diplomatic personnel, and then shut down every avenue of escape, by air, sea, and land. There is no evidence, however, that the surveillance team did this on the morning of July 20. Instead, they seem to have done what timeservers do in every autocracy that punishes honest failure: they did nothing at all, and<br/>hoped the problem would go away. [...] Weekends are lethargic times in all large bureaucracies, when the second-tier staff comes to work and the boss relaxes. The KGB began looking for Gordievsky, but without particular urgency.</blockquote><br/><br/>An MI5 agent:<br/><br/><blockquote>He was occasionally overheard at parties drunkenly shouting: “I’m working for the wrong side” and “Come and see me in my dacha when I retire.” Six months before the first delivery to Guk, Bettaney had been found sitting on a sidewalk in London’s West End, too inebriated to stand. When taken into custody for being drunk in a public place, he shouted at police: “You can’t arrest me, I’m a spy.” He was fined £10. MI5 did not accept his offer of resignation.</blockquote>",,,0,0

I also found useful their discussion of insecure achievers (get a lot done but nothing is ever good enough) vs pessimistic achievers (worry they may not get it done and hence self-sabotage).<br/><br/>Other parts of the book ""feel right"" but lack supporting evidence. Ex.: I 100% agree that how a person spends their free time (say, watching some stupid reality show vs learning a new programming language) is a ""high signal"" variable that helps predict curiosity, creativity, and self-motivation. But maybe I'm wrong - there must be some research on this, and it would be nice to see it.<br/><br/>Finally, they never bother to define talent. In the first chapter they say that ""talent can't be identified algorithmically"". Well, wrong - if by ""talent"" you mean ""job performance"". Structured interviews are the best recruiting method - just score each candidate, rank them, and make an offer to the top-ranked one. <a href=""https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1345850503629066240"">Here's</a> evidence.

W. Norton & Company,Hardcover,384,2022,2021,2022/03/10,2021/12/24,,,read,"Wow, those first few chapters. They should be required reading in any conversation about gender equality. They move the conversation from the anecdotal to the systematic. To quote but one data point: in the US Supreme Court women are 1/3 of the justices but they suffer 2/3 of all interruptions, 96% of them by men.<br/><br/>Those chapters changed how I view the gender imbalance in STEM careers. I used to think it was just a matter of different genders choosing to pursue different interests. But no. It's more complicated than that. Boys and girls are about equally good at math, but girls are much better than boys at reading, so ""doing what you're best at"" in relative terms (as opposed to absolute ones) can help explain the different career choices of men and women. I had never thought about the gender imbalance in STEM in terms of David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantages, but it makes total sense.<br/><br/>That's only part of the picture though. Sieghart reviews the literature on hiring biases and it was disturbing to learn that the same (fake) resume is much more hireable when it has a male-sounding name. This is not observational data, but experimental data: identical resumes, changing only the name. Hard to argue with that. Hiring practices need to change a lot.<br/><br/>After those first few chapters, sadly, it's all downhill. The book becomes less and less evidence-backed as the chapters go by. So, books written by men sell by a much higher price. Sure, but are men and women writing the same types of books? For instance, technical books are more expensive than novels; do we have a comparable number of men and women writing each genre? The issue is the pipeline (see above).<br/><br/>Then it gets worse. Sieghart speaks fondly of implicit association bias, which is as pseudoscience as homeopathy or chromotherapy. Measures of implicit association bias are <a href=""https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcs.1569"">meaningless</a>: they have no construct validity and no predictive validity. In other words, they measure nothing and they predict nothing.<br/><br/>Then it gets really bad. Sieghart gets into ""intersectionalism"", which is just outright idiocy. There are infinite possible intersections: not just gender and race and sexuality and disability but also political orientation, food choices, regional accent, and so on. You can't arbitrarily pick some combinations of characteristics and declare that *they* are the ones that matter. To quote a female immigrant <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/432.Ayn_Rand"">philosopher</a>, “The smallest minority on earth is the individual.”<br/><br/>Finally, the words ""evolutionary psychology"" do not appear anywhere in the book. There should be a whole chapter dedicated to it. Evolutionary psychology helps explain a lot of different behaviors between men and women and - unlike intersectionalism or implicit bias - is an actual science, backed by peer-reviewed research. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb8fH9wouYI"">Here</a>'s a nice intro, by Professor Diana Fleischman.",,,1,0

This book is meant for managers of assembly line workers. For Grove's advice to be applicable: a) your business needs to produce a homogeneous output (say, microchips or sausages); b) you need to be able to model that output as a function of known inputs (silicon, pork), used in known quantities; and c) that output needs to remain essentially the same over time. That's not how the knowledge economy works. It's mind-boggling that Ben Horowitz of all people wrote the foreword and that this book is cited by every other tech management book out there.<br/><br/>In a sense, this book is all about optimizing process. Which is the opposite of, say, Netflix' ""<a href=""https://jobs.netflix.com/culture"">people over process</a>"" philosophy that emphasizes hiring smart people who have the right values and trusting them to do what needs to be done. Imagine if Netflix had focused its energies on optimizing DVD delivery instead of asking the broader question ""how can we make it easier for people to watch stuff?"".<br/><br/>It's particularly hard to see how this book might help data science teams, which is what I'm most interested in. The output is heterogeneous: one day you're clustering users to create a recommender system, the next day you're forecasting sales, the day after that you're doing some exploratory analysis. There is no stable function linking input (brainpower, computing power) to output: sometimes you try everything under the sun and still can't get good accuracy; sometimes you get lucky right off the bat. You need a little bit of process to keep data pipelines in order, monitor model decay, etc, but this is a world completely different from the one in Grove's ""breakfast factory"" vignette.<br/><br/>Some of Grove's specific pieces of advice are just outright absurd. Like this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>... if a manager walks through an area and sees a person with whom he has a two-minute concern, he can simply stop, cover it, and be on his way. [...] such visits are an extremely effective and efficient way to transact managerial business.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>What the heck? It takes on average <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/944128/worker-interrupted-cost-task-switching"">23 minutes and 15 seconds</a> to recover from a distraction. A manager of knowledge workers needs to protect his team's focus at all costs (see Paul Graham's essay ""<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html"">Maker's schedule, manager's schedule</a>""). Walking around bothering people is the very opposite of that.<br/><br/>Grove does acknowledge that interruptions are bad, but his concern is with ICs interrupting the manager, not the other way around (!). Look at this:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Interruptions had a common source, most frequently coming from subordinates ...<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Wow.<br/><br/>That's in line with Grove's top-down view of what a ""team"" is. Here is his take on one-on-ones, for instance:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>By talking about specific problems and situations, the supervisor teaches the subordinate his skills and know-how ...<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Wow 2x. Imagine managing devs or data scientists with that sort of command-and-control approach.<br/><br/>Grove does offer sensible advice here and there. A manager's output isn't about his individual work but about the multiplier effect he has on the team's output. Reports/plans are not about the documents per se, but about how they force the organization to reflect about how it's doing - even a report that's never read by anyone can be valuable. Delegation is not abdication. Monitoring is not meddling. Etc, etc. But these are pockets of common sense lost in a sea of Taylorism.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good book on tech management go with Camille Fournier's <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33369254-the-manager-s-path"">The Manager's Path</a> instead.",,,1,0

Lots of great insights illustrated with the best anecdotes. My take-aways:<br/><br/>- Assess not just market risk but also fraud risk. Thorp was cheated at casinos early in his career, in all sorts of ways (they even poisoned his coffee). Then in 1991 he was among the first to call out Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme - for which Madoff wouldn't be convicted until 2009, even though the SEC had been alerted to his fraud multiple times over the years. (That's the same SEC that is now cracking down on crypto exchanges ""to protect consumers."") So, don't trust the authorities, do your own due diligence instead.<br/><br/>- Have a clear exit strategy for each investment. Otherwise you end up anchoring. The price you paid for the stock doesn't matter, all that matters is where the price going thereafter.<br/><br/>- Sales matter. To create his first fund Thorp visited court houses to collect data on limited partnerships. He got the contact info of the limited partners and cold-called them. Most academic economists would rather starve than ""debase"" themselves by doing sales work.<br/><br/>- Sometimes you have to choose between making money and being published. Thorp came up with Black-Scholes before Black-Scholes, but he was more interested in using it than in claiming bragging rights.<br/><br/>- If you are a professor, never ever agree to become the head of the department. Thorp's stories are horrifying (though they jibe with what I've seen): nasty infighting, absenteeism, zero accountability.<br/><br/>- Read Nassim Taleb (Thorp quotes him multiple times throughout the book). Thorp talks about some hedge fund that had simulated the effect of previous crashes (1987, 1999, etc) on their portfolio. They found they could withstand all of them with small losses. But 2008 came and they lost over 50% of their AUM. 2008 was qualitatively different from the previous crises - it was a black swan.<br/><br/>And lots more.<br/><br/>Towards the end Thorp gets a bit more specific about investment strategies (he talks about finding a subset of the S&P500 that closely tracks the S&P500 but can be more tax-efficient and lead to interesting strategies, for instance). But that's not the point of the book, which is more about the big picture.",,,1,0

It's been over a decade since I took the seminar and I can recall maybe two or three instances of having used what I learned there.

The author didn't interview a single high-frequency trader and he doesn't seriously engage any of the arguments about how HFT can make markets more efficient (price discovery, etc). Hence the villain/hero narrative. Maybe the pro-HFT arguments are bunk - what do I know, I'm not in finance - but I know they exist and I wish Lewis had made some effort to address them.<br/><br/>That said, I still learned a great deal. The bits about Reg NMS show how regulation is part of the problem, not the solution. Reg NMS mandates that each order must go through all exchanges, so that the broker can find the best national price. That makes arbitrage possible - if you can ""see"" the order before it reaches all exchanges (and you can, because of latency) then you can front-run it.<br/><br/>I doubt that Brad Katsuyama and his crew are the vestal virgins Lewis paints, but it's impossible not to admire them. A woke version of Katsuyama would have written a passionate éxposé of HFT on Medium or The Atlantic and he would conclude that we need more regulation. Real-life Katsuyama, however, is a builder.<br/><br/><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/bSSLQNn.png""><br/><br/>I also loved reading about how difficult it was for Katsuyama and his crew to understand the problem in the first place. They knew something was amiss but it took them years of tests and head-scratching to figure it out. And these are high-IQ people who were already working in finance or finance-adjacent fields.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed learning about Sergey Aleynikov - a Russian programmer at Goldman Sachs who was sentenced to prison. His crime: commiting code to a Subversion repository. All I know about the case is from this book, so I have no idea if the man was stealing intellectual property or not. But man, a lot of people commit code to GitHub or email it to themselves or whatnot so they can work on it later - I've done it countless times.

On top of that, Schwager is a superb interviewer and he shows the world of retail traders in a way that's neither the aggregate statistics of academic papers nor the get-rich-quick Youtube ads selling day trading courses. I've always thought of traders as people who somehow missed Burton Malkiel's <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40242274-a-random-walk-down-wall-street"">A Random Walk Down Wall Street</a>. Schwager showed me a much more interesting picture. Here are some highlights:<br/><br/><b>skill vs luck</b><br/><br/>The eleven traders in the book all have spectacular performances. We're talking annualized returns of 20%-300%, sometimes for several years. But the book doesn't give us enough data to know whether those performances are the result of skill or mere luck. If you ride a big bull market it's possible to have stellar returns with random bets. Bitcoin has yielded an annualized return of 558% since May 2015. That doesn't make early Bitcoin adopters market wizards (though some of them certainly are).<br/><br/>""The magnitude by which the traders in this book outperformed market benchmarks over long periods (typically, decade-plus) cannot simply be explained away as 'luck.'"", Schwager writes (p. 348). To give only two examples, Daljit Dhaliwal never had a negative year and he was profitable in 95% of quarters, and Pavel Krejcí had positive returns in 93% of all quarters. But to tell luck from skill we would need to know who was trading what when and what each monthly return was, then follow an approach like <a href=""https://sci-hub.do/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01598.x"">Fama & French's</a> where they compare actual returns with simulated returns. Schwager doesn't give us a data appendix, so we can't do that. (The data is not Schwager's to publicize but he could have run the numbers himself and showed us the results.)<br/><br/>It's tempting to guess which of the eleven traders are skilled (as opposed to merely lucky) based on the narrative each of them offers. Several of them emphasize the importance of updating your beliefs based on new information (so that you can limit your losses if the market turns against you, for instance), but without overcorrecting. Some also emphasize the importance of sizing your bets according to how confident you are. These attitudes are typical of Philip Tetlock's <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995360-superforecasting"">superforecasters</a>.<br/><br/>But they are just narratives. Each trader (except for the one quant guy) is describing his mental model of himself. That mental model is probably a <a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/robkhenderson/status/1390030258859040773"">better</a> trader than the actual human behind it. And at times the narratives sound wishy-washy: ""I am using my feelings as an input to trading."" (p. 110), ""The human emotions that we feel can be used as a signal source."" (p. 193), that sort of thing. (Though for the most part the narratives are pretty Tetlockian.)<br/><br/>In short, it is possible that Schwager selected eleven very lucky people and then spent hours listening to after-the-fact rationalizations. But even if that's the case (which I don't know) the book is still immensely enjoyable if you are curious about retail trading.<br/><br/><b>people who are always wrong can make (you) money</b><br/><br/>My favorite strategy is one of Jason Shapiro's:<br/><br/><blockquote>I watch <i>Fast Money</i> religiously at 5 p.m. EST every day. I can't tell you how much money I've made off of that show. [...] There is one guy on the program named Brian Kelly, who I have now watched for years. He is wrong by such a larger percentage than random that it is hard to believe. I will never have a position on if he is recommending it. (p. 69) </blockquote><br/><br/>I don't know if that really works or if Shapiro is just rationalizing but I love the idea and now I want to find Fast Money transcripts and backtest it.<br/><br/><b>shrinking anomalies</b><br/><br/>Several of the interviewees believe that anomalies are disappearing.<br/><br/>Peter Brandt, talking about how things have changed for chartists since the 1980s:<br/><br/><blockquote>Large long-term patterns no longer work. Trendlines no longer work. Channels no longer work. Symmetrical triangles no longer work. (p. 37)</blockquote><br/><br/>Richard Bargh:<br/><br/><blockquote>there are also far fewer opportunities now than back in 2013 and 2014. Back then, many things were still relatively new, like quantitative easing and forward guidance. There was more uncertainty about what the central banks were going to do and how they were going to do it. Whereas now, the markets have central banks so nailed down that there is not as much opportunity to make money on central banks as there once was. The markets now are good at pricing in events before they happen. I make money by pricing in a surprise, and with fewer surprises, there are fewer opportunities. (p. 100)</blockquote><br/><br/>Amrit Sall:<br/><br/><blockquote>increased market automation and high-frequency-trading algorithms have made execution harder and eroded my edge on some very short time frame strategies. (p. 142)</blockquote><br/><br/>Daljit Dhaliwal:<br/><br/><blockquote>It is no longer possible to trade for the initial move off the headline because the algos will make the trade before I can. (p. 157)</blockquote><br/><br/>It makes sense. Data is cheaper, processing power is cheaper, machine learning courses are free; it would be odd if anomalies didn't disappear.<br/><br/><b>patience</b><br/><br/>Another common theme is the importance of waiting for the right trade.<br/><br/>Richard Bargh says you should have a side project:<br/><br/><blockquote>One thing about event-driven trading is that if there isn’t an event to trade, there is nothing to do, and it is really boring. You can feel like you’re wasting your life. [...] I have found that I trade much better when I have a side project. If I have nothing else to do but trade events, and there are no events to trade, my mind runs wild. I need to focus my attention on something; otherwise, I will focus on the wrong things. (p. 104)</blockquote><br/><br/>Bargh again:<br/><br/><blockquote>Trading to earn a consistent amount steadily may be an admirable goal, but it is not a realistic one. Market opportunities are sporadic. [...] If you try to force consistent profitability, you will be prone to take suboptimal trades, which will often end up reducing your overall profitability. (p. 177)</blockquote><br/><br/>Amrit Sall:<br/><br/><blockquote>There will be periods in the markets where opportunities dry up, and there will be nothing to do. In those nothing periods, if you are looking for something to do, that is when you can create real damage to your account. (p. 129)</blockquote><br/><br/>Daljit Dhaliwal:<br/><br/><blockquote>you don’t have to take every potential trade. You can wait for a trade where everything lines up in your favor. (p. 154)</blockquote><br/><br/>Chris Camillo articulated it best:<br/><br/><blockquote>Looking back, I think a big part of my success when I went back to trading was my ability to look past the noise and be patient. I wasn’t in the industry. It wasn’t my job, and I wasn’t under any pressure to trade. I could go six months without a trade, and I didn’t have to answer to anybody. (p. 239)</blockquote><br/><br/>(The other day I was listening to a podcast <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/episode/4bcqtYTVEDB0d20Dz45OaC?si=zKLs9AlWR5e5UHyQ4tE0Hw"">interview</a> with a quant fund manager and he emphasized that ""we work a lot, we don't just create a bot and then go to the beach"". It's odd that people choose to invest in a <i>quant</i> fund but then expect constant human activity - as long as the fund is making you money what do you care that the staff is at the beach? But apparently investors want busy managers.)<br/><br/>What Camillo says ties in with Marsten Parker's advice:<br/><br/><blockquote>Don’t quit your day job. (p. 287)</blockquote><br/><br/>If you have a stable source of income it'll probably be easier to avoid overtrading.<br/><br/><b>TickerTags</b><br/><br/>One of my favorite interviews in the book is the one with Chris Camillo. He mines social media looking for information that might help him anticipate stock price movements. Like when there was an outbreak of <i>E. Coli</i> in Chipotle stores:<br/><br/><blockquote>Chipotle had become famous for having long lines at lunchtime. Chipotle was such a trendy brand that it was common for people to tweet about having lunch there. They would also frequently tweet about how they were waiting in line at Chipotle. I was able to gauge real-time foot traffic by monitoring word combinations, such as ""Chipotle"" plus ""lunch,"" and ""Chipotle"" plus ""line,"" in online conversations. Almost overnight, the mentions of these word combinations dropped by about 50%.</blockquote><br/><br/>I imagine NLP folks at quant shops reading about Camillo and his Chipotle trade. There they are, fine-tuning BERT and whatnot, and then Camillo with his hard-coded bigrams makes a killing.<br/><br/>Camillo made a business out of that: he created TickerTags, a company that tracks word combinations on social media. As Camillo says, tracking conversations is a way to ""go even earlier than trasactional data"" (like credit card information).<br/><br/>TickerTags doesn't seem to have been successful with hedge funds though:<br/><br/><blockquote>Hedge fund managers want something repeatable and systematic. They wanted to know how often this approach would generate tradable information with high conviction. I couldn’t give them a hard answer. (p. 253)</blockquote><br/><br/>That is a recurrent theme throughout the book. The trader ""knows"" that the strategy works but somehow can't put a number on it. Peter Brandt says if the market closes in a new high or in a new low on a Friday then it is likely to keep moving in that direction on Monday and early Tuesday. But when asked if he ever checked that pattern he replies ""I have never statistically analyzed it."" Hhmm.<br/><br/><b>the one quant guy</b><br/><br/>Marsten Parker is the only quant in the group. He touches on an interesting point:<br/><br/><blockquote>I’ve always struggled with how to distinguish between a routine drawdown and a system that has stopped working. (p. 278)</blockquote><br/><br/>Last month I finished reading Marcos López de Prado's <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38365403-advances-in-financial-machine-learning"">Advances in Financial Machine Learning</a>. de Prado talks about how the death of a strategy can actually be a good thing:<br/><br/><blockquote>For instance, a mean-reverting pattern may give way to a momentum pattern. As this transition takes place, most market participants are caught off guard, and they will make costly mistakes. This sort of errors is the basis for many profitable strategies, because the actors on the losing side will typically become aware of their mistake once it is too late. Before they accept their losses, they will act irrationally, try to hold the position, and hope for a comeback. Sometimes they will even increase a losing position, in desperation. Eventually they will be forced to stop loss or stop out. Structural breaks offer some of the best risk/rewards. (p. 249)</blockquote><br/><br/>de Prado suggests a number of tests to identify structural breaks - for instance, testing if the cumulative forecasting errors look random. I wonder if that's the sort of thing Parker is doing. He doesn't get into technical details though, other than to mention that he's learned about overfitting the hard way, that he uses parameter stability as an indicator of robustness, that your errors will be more serially correlated in real life than in your backtest, and that it's best to have several simple strategies than one over-optimized strategy. (Also: ""The more strategies you run, the easier it is emotionally to turn one off."", p. 286.)<br/><br/>I love this:<br/><br/><blockquote>if I knew everything I do now, I might never have tried trading in the first place. (p. 286)</blockquote><br/><br/>I imagine all the state-of-the-art models that RenTec or AQR must be training, the hordes of Mensa Ph.D.s they recruit, the deep pockets they have to buy credit card data or Twitter's Firehose, I think of Quantopian's failure, and it sounds impossible to me that any sort of artisanal, DIY quant approach could succeed. But maybe Parker isn't just lucky. His interview updated my priors a bit.<br/><br/><b>loving your trade</b><br/><br/>The appeal of trading is that it is something you can do on your own - no employees, no bosses, no clients, no students, no reviewers, no drama, no politics, no culture wars.<br/><br/>Jason Shapiro:<br/><br/><blockquote>I had six people working for me, and I hated it. I didn’t like managing people and being responsible for their success. (p. 72)</blockquote><br/><br/>Pavel Krejcí:<br/><br/><blockquote>I wanted to find something where the success or failure would depend only on me, not my colleagues, my boss, or anybody else. If I make money, that’s great; if I lose money, it’s my mistake. (p. 320)</blockquote><br/><br/>That's happinness almost by definition.<br/><br/>Alright, any more quotes and I'll probably get a lawsuit so I'm stopping here. Go buy the book.",,,1,0

I had never thought that you could use volume or dollar bars (as opposed to time bars), for instance. I imagine finance folks have known that for a long time, but it completely blew my mind. (Though there is some good pushback <a href=""https://www.tradientblog.com/2019/11/lessons-learned-building-an-ml-trading-system-that-turned-5k-into-200k/"">here</a>: ""when acting based on volume traded we may be too late already."") Similarly, I had never thought about how differentiating might eliminate signal. I saw fractional differentiation in grad school, in passing, but I had never found real-world applications for it (probably because I haven't done a lot of work with time series). I finally understand how it can be useful. Also, I had never thought that you could do cross-validation in a combinatorial way, with multiple test sets at a time. That is something I will probably try in non-finance work too.<br/><br/>Now, I wish de Prado had separated data and strategy more clearly. Take chapter 13 - ""Backtesting on Synthetic Data"" -, for example. You'd expect it to be about using Monte Carlos to generate synthetic market data (which you could then use to backtest your strategy). But no. The synthetic data includes the trading rules themselves. Why conflate both things like this? What if I just want to simulate market data, so that later I can use it to backtest whatever strategy I want? That might keep things simpler, clearer, easier to handle. (Can we even call it backtesting if you're trying to optimize the parameters of your strategy? Aren't these different things? What am I missing here?)<br/><br/>It's the same with the triple barrier labeling. I get it - ""Every investment strategy has stop-loss limits"" (p. 44). But it conflates data and strategy, which not only makes the whole thing harder to reason about, but also introduces problems like leakage and low uniqueness, which de Prado then spends entire chapters explaining how to fix. Those problems wouldn't exist in the first place if our labels were not dependent on our strategy. The man is clearly a genius (and he knows that - the book has a Taleb-ish style at times), I'm sure he has good reasons for suggesting triple barrier labeling, but where is the evidence that all this additional complication pays off in terms of higher Sharpe or some other metric?<br/><br/>I also wonder whether some of these choices - dollar bars vs volume bars, triple barrier labeling vs conventional labeling, etc - could be learned from the data. I know, I know, overfitting. But I wish de Prado had discussed this possiblity, even if to dismiss it. (Maybe reinforcement learning is the final destination? Btw, it would be great if de Prado could add a chapter on reinforcement learning for finance in a future edition.)<br/><br/>Finally, this is a super dense book (though de Prado warns you of that right in the beginning). Some passages I had to read 2, 3, 4 times to understand, and a few passages I just didn't understand at all. I hadn't struggled so hard with a technical book since grad school. The language could be more clear and precise. The notation could be more consistent. And examples with real-world data would help. (There are lots of code snipets though, and they are super helpful.)<br/><br/>All that said, this is an amazing book that anyone who wants to do algorithmic trading should read.",,,1,0

It's comprehensive, straight-to-the-point, focused on empirical evidence, clearly written. <br/><br/>TL;DR: intelligence is real, it is not that hard to measure, it is not a proxy for parental income, it is largely inheritable, it correlates with brain size and anatomy, it predicts important life outcomes (like academic and professional success), it differs across races in ways that cannot be attributed to environmental influences (though the distributions largely overlap and there are people of all races in all intelligence brackets). Also, Gardner's multiple intelligences theory is not falsiable (which makes it less scientific than, say, astrology).<br/><br/>There are a few wrinkles. Most importantly, the Flynn effect. Warne attributes it to abilities that are not related to general intelligence. But this (if correct) has important implications - maybe IQ tests need to be improved, etc - that Warne doesn't fully consider.<br/><br/>Also, the final chapters are a bit ""meh"". They are philosophical in nature, so there isn't much to engage with.

The financial planning advice is of the Captain Obvious variety - ""pay off credit card and high-interest debts"", ""establish an emergency fund"", etc. Not super useful, but not harmful either. The investment advice, in turn, is all over the place. ""Buy index funds because passive beats active"" - fair enough, lots of research corroborate that. But then you can add ""a value and/or a small-cap fund"", and Real Estate Investment Trusts can be ""a worthwhile addition to larger portfolios"". What gives? Either passive beats active, in which case you shouldn't tilt your portfolio towards any specific factors or industries, or it doesn't, in which case you should do stock picking.<br/><br/>Not to mention the magical numbers. ""We suggest that REIT funds not exceed 10 percent of your equity allocation."" Based on... what? Did the authors use efficient frontier to get to that number?

I had never thought about how we can adjust the closing price to account for intraday volatility, or about how most Sharpe ratios are inflated because they don't correct for multiple backtests, or about how we can use the Sharpe ratio to size our bets. I'm glad I bought this book and read it through. Also, it's great that the author provides code snippets.<br/><br/>That said, this book needs a major revision. The writing is unacceptably poor. At times it's hard to know who is doing what. Look at this paragraph:<br/><br/><blockquote>The goal of meta-labeling is to train a secondary model on the prediction outcomes of a primary model, where losses are labeled as “0” and gains are labeled as “1.” Therefore, the secondary model does not predict the side. Instead, the secondary model predicts whether the primary model will succeed or fail at a particular prediction (a meta-prediction). The probability associated with a “1” prediction can then be used to size the position, as explained next.</blockquote><br/><br/>When he says ""...where losses are labeled as '0' and gains are labeled as '1'"" is he referring to the primary model or to the secondary model? And the ""probability associated with a '1' prediction' is something I can get from the primary model itself - why do I need a secondary model here? The paragraph ends with ""as explained next"" but what comes next is how to use these probabilities (whose model's?) to size bets, not how the secondary model fits into the picture.<br/><br/>Another issue is that the author doesn't bother to justify many of his choices. Like in his discussion of mean-decrease accuracy, for instance. He suggests shuffling the feature (thus breaking the sample-feature correspondence) to see how much that decreases the model's performance. Sounds reasonable, but what's the advantage of doing that versus simply dropping the feature altogether?<br/><br/>Relatedly, it would be great to see some real-world examples in the book. The code snippets are super helpful (and often necessary to understand the point, given the poor writing). But they all use synthetic data. I'm sold on the ""Monte Carlos beat p-values"" approach, but real-world examples would give us a sense of how much better the authors' solutions are, compared to the ones he is criticizing.<br/><br/>Finally, the book is missing a chapter on forecasting models. It's great to learn about labeling, feature importance, etc, but the point of all these concepts is to help us produce better forecasts. Where is the chapter that discusses and compares ARIMAX, LSTM, Markov, etc? It feels like the most important topic has been left out of the book.<br/><br/>Oh, just one more thing: buy the paper version, not the Kindle version.

Before I read this book I was googling Estonia and Vietnam ETFs, studying the portfolio of ARK funds, scanning the news for upcoming tech IPOs, etc. This book gave me pause and probably saved me a ton of money.<br/><br/><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/prvXA8F.png"" width=""400"" height=""400""><br/>(from chapter 16)<br/><br/>Also, this: ""as the holding period increases to between fifteen and twenty years, the riskiness of stocks falls bellow that of fixed-income assets"" (chapter 12). Again, not exactly shocking news that risk is a function of time, but Siegel articulates the point more clearly than I've ever seen elsewhere. It's easy to forget that inflation, well, inflates a company's prices and assets, so in the long run stock returns have to adjust for that, while bonds offer no such ""natural"" protection. (And that is probably especially true in countries whose governments have a history of ""tweaking"" official inflation indices, not to mention countries whose governments have a history of outright defaulting.)<br/><br/>The book is from 2005 but at times it feels like Siegel is addressing 2021 investors. Like when he discusses the signs of a bubble:<br/><br/><blockquote>... extraordinarily high valuations based on concepts and names instead of earnings or even revenues, and un unwavering belief that the world has fundamentally changed and that these firms cannot be measured by traditional means.</blockquote><br/><br/>And see if this doesn't make you think of today's SPACs:<br/><br/><blockquote>To bypass the lengthy process of going public, a company could conduct a 'reverse acquisition' and effectively merge with NetJ.com. In other words, NetJ.com was a shell in which other companies could live. With internet mania raging, dot-com companies rushed to sell shares quickly to a more-than-willing public, and a merger was much faster than the lengthy process of issuing an IPO. [...] The only source of value for NetJ.com will be 'entirely dependent' upon its management in locating a 'suitable acquisition or merger candidate.'</blockquote><br/><br/>In 2021 there is even a SPAC whose ticker is JAAC, which stands for ""Just Another Acquisition""; and you can now buy SPAC ETFs.<br/><br/>I also learned a lot from Siegel's discussion of how different companies calculate their earnings differently, and how that may affect the P/E ratio. He discusses the concept of ""core earnings"" and I wonder if that could apply to every country and how the P/E ratios would change, say, in Brazil, if Brazilian companies adopted it, and what investment strategies could be built on top of the gap between conventional P/E ratios and P/E ratios based on core earnings.<br/><br/>This is an uneven book though - about 1/3 of it is just opinative or speculative. For instance, Siegel goes on and on about how you should buy stocks that pay dividends because dividends are a strong signal of value. And he shows that some dividend-based strategies (like the ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy) would have been successful. But you could find a strategy that involves, say, picking companies with 5-letter names, and show that it too would have beaten the market. I'm reading Marcos López de Prado's ""Advances in Financial Machine Learning"" and he has seven chapters on all the stuff you need to worry about when doing backtesting; TL;DR: it's 100x more complicated than saying ""you would have beaten the market if you had picked these companies"", which is what Siegel does.<br/><br/>Also, Siegel doesn't engage the literature that shows dividends to be irrelevant. Math-wise, it isn't that hard: $1 paid in dividends means $1 less in market value. And that's a literature that stretches back at least to the 1960s (see <a href=""https://sci-hub.do/10.2307/2351143"">here</a>), not something that only started after the book came out. Stocks that pay good dividends do tend to perform better, but there is <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=570343"">evidence</a> showing that that's because dividend-paying stocks have excess exposure to the value, profitability, and investment factors. Hence you can do just as well by buying stocks that have similar excess exposure to those factors, whether they pay dividends or not - which about doubles your pool of stocks to choose from.<br/><br/>Finally, Siegel makes a scary prediction that haven't materialized. He says that as boomers retire they will sell their stocks and bonds, which will make prices go down a lot. Sixteen years later, the S&P500 has a P/E ratio of about 27 - it was 17 when the book came out. Maybe a lot of boomers haven't retired yet, maybe investors in developing countries are buying a lot of US stocks; who knows. Whatever the reason, that part of the book has aged like milk.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws though this book is great and totally worth it.",,,1,0

In the end the state found a way to tax online businesses, so the big transition to a stateless society hasn't happened. The authors make a big deal of encryption. And yet we still pay taxes in 2021, even though our online purchases and online banking are all based on encrypted communication. Bummer.<br/><br/>Reading this 1997 book in 2021, it's tempting to think that blockchain will change things - that *now* the internet will finally be decentralized, economic activity will be untaxable, and the state will collapse. Maybe this book wasn't wrong, just early? But that's like being a marxist who sees every financial crisis as *the* ultimate crisis of capitalism. The state has adapted to disruptive technologies before - even to encryption -, it might very well adapt to blockchain and to quantum computing and to whatever comes next.<br/><br/>Other predictions have materialized though. The part about ""cybercash"" is essentially about Bitcoin - except that it predates Bitcoin by eleven years. The authors talk about how ""cybercash"" will make it harder for states to tax through inflation, and it is precisely in countries that have seen inflation rise in the 2010s, like Argentina and Venezuela, that Bitcoin has been most popular.<br/><br/>It's also hard not to think of Estonia's e-residency program, created in 2014, when the authors predict small nations competing for citizens, and that such competition wouldn't necessarily involve immigration. And it's impossible not to think about Amazon Turk and Upwork when the authors talk about technology will accelerate the transition from jobs to project-specific work - a post-Coasean economy.<br/><br/>Also, the authors anticipate the hordes of humanities majors and journalists with no no marketable skills who have turned against technology and capitalism:<br/><br/>“The nationalist and Luddite reaction will be strongest, however, not among the very poor but among persons of middling skills, underachievers with credentials, who came of age during the industrial era and face downward mobility.”<br/><br/>Relatedly, the authors correctly predict the multiplication of self-declared (and more or less officially recognized) ""oppressed"" categories. And they offer a neat theory about it: ""We see the growth of victimization as mainly an attempt to buy social peace by not only widening membership in the meritocracy as [Christopher] Lash argues, but also by reconstituting the rationalizations for income redistribution.""<br/><br/>Fake news and echo chambers are also there: ""you'll even be able to order a nightly news report that simulates the news you would like to hear. [...] You'll see any story you wish, true or false, unfold on your television/computer"".<br/><br/>It's also great to be reminded of how absurd it is to consider ""fair"" that ""different persons should pay wildly different amounts for the services of government"". Why should someone with an income of US$ 2X pay twice as much tax than someone with an income of US$ X? If anything policing wealthier neighborhoods is *cheaper* than policing poorer neighborhoods. In fact the lower your income the more likely you will use up *more* state resources, so you should pay more taxes, not less.<br/><br/>Finally, every now and then it's good to be reminded that our faith in democracy is no less ludicrous than a medieval peasant's faith in the Church. The authors do a good job drawing parallels between the religious myths of 1000 years ago and the civic myths of today. The state is nothing more than the stationary bandit of Mancur Olson's ""Power and Prosperity"" - but the mythology around the state is strong and it's easy to forget that we're all serfs.",,,1,0

Though not in the same sense of, say, House of Cards. This is not about complex machinations or smart people. This is about fear and ordinary people. One day you're a trusted intimate of the Generalíssimo. The next day he wakes up on the wrong side of the bed; suddenly you're no longer senator, your bank accounts are frozen, you're under investigation. You wonder what it is you've done. You worry you may get arrested. You worry about your family. You wonder if there is anything you can do to regain the man's favor.<br/><br/>This is also violence porn. King Joffrey is a clumsy little bully apprentice compared to Trujillo. The violence is not gratuitous though. It's one thing to learn from Wikipedia that this many people were killed, that that many people were tortured, etc. It's another thing entirely to turn the victims of the regime into relatable characters and to make the reader care about them. And Vargas Llosa does that brilliantly here.<br/><br/>Also, shout out to the narrators of the Audible version.

This book convinced me that I was wrong: it's not that there aren't inefficiencies to be exploited in financial markets, it's just that humans suck at seeing them. The same cognitive biases that create those inefficiencies in the first place also prevent us from exploiting them. We see signal where there is only noise, we anchor our expectations, we become emotionally invested in our choices. But the machine is immune to all that.<br/><br/>Zuckerman gets into a lot more detail about Renaissance's models than I expected him to. I guess by now there are enough ex-employees willing to share company secrets. Or maybe the company secrets they are willing to share are not that big anymore: using Markov chains to model price movements, looking for price ratios instead of absolute prices, etc. Whatever is happening at quant funds right now is probably way beyond any of that (convolutional neural networks that count cars in Walmart's parking lots, that sort of thing).<br/><br/>I was ready to roll up my sleeves and start modelling stuff, but fortunately I got to this point in the book first: ""In the five years leading up to spring of 2019, quant-focused hedge funds gained about 4.2 percent a year on average, compared with a gain of 3.3 percent for the average hedge fund in the same period."" Well, the S&P500 yields on average 9.8% a year (6% after inflation). For Simons to get his average 66% yearly return he had to hire a team of geniuses. I'm no genius, and I'm not in a position to hire any geniuses to work for me, so I guess I'm staying with index funds (except maybe for some ""fun money"").<br/><br/>Overall this is a well written, well researched book, and I got a lot out of it.",,,1,0

It feels like you're reading the first draft of a time travel story written by an 11-year old who just saw Back to the Future for the first time. Banal dialogues. Endless repetitions of inane phrases (""the past is obdurate"" appears on every other paragraph). Unbelievably stupid characters (dude finds a ""time hole"" and uses it for... buying meat at 1958 prices so he can sell cheap burgers in 2011; I kid you not). Every time travel cliche under the sun (there is even a sports almanac, if you can believe that).<br/><br/>All of that might have been tolerable if the plot were good. But for most of the book there is no plot. It's just a 2011 guy wandering around in 1958. Mingling with the locals, drinking beer, driving a Sunliner. Then he meets the most annoying female character of all sci-fi literature and they fall in love and their idiotic romance takes up maybe 1/3 of the book. The part where he actually tries to save JFK (with incredibly stupid plans, btw) takes up maybe 10% of the book. This could have been a novella or even a novelette. But no, the whole thing stretches out for thirty hours (I listened to the audio version). Thirty LONG hours.<br/><br/>It's stunning that this garbage has a an average of 4.3 stars on Goodreads.

But it could be hundreds of pages shorter, especially towards the end. Also, I hate the cheap attempt to connect the different Neal Stephenson's fictional universes to make people buy the other books. Screw Enoch Root and the Shaftoes, they had no place in this story. Finally, Ameristan feels like a silly nod to current anti-tech, anti-social media alarmists; it doesn't really help move the story forward.

Caplan is denouncing the very assumption of rationality that underpins so much of economic theory - which is pretty heterodox of him. And he's making the discussion accessible to general public,  which is what one would expect political scientists to have done long ago. But political scientists have generally endorsed the idea of ""one person, one vote"" because they see it as more conducive to redistributive/welfare policies. Hence for the most part political scientists have confined their discussions of voter behavior to academic papers that journalists (or median voters; or entrepreneurial politicians) are unlikely to read. It took a Bryan Caplan to familiarize the general public with the notion of rational ignorance and to fully explore its most important implication, i.e., that perhaps we should consider restricting the franchise. That probably sounded like lunacy when the book first came out, back in 2007, but my guess is that now, after Trump's election, even political scientists might be a bit more open to the idea.",,,1,0

I've been investing in index funds and government bonds for decades and I expected Graham to convince me to do otherwise - to show me that it's possible to beat the market. Instead he argues - quite convincingly - that passive investing (what he calls a ""defensive portfolio"") is what makes most sense unless you're willing to spend several hours a day inspecting companies' fundamentals (and even then there's a good chance that the market will beat you).<br/><br/>Not an entertaining reading though. Graham subjects the reader to long, detailed discussions of stock prices in the US in the late 1960s. There are useful, timeless lessons in those boring discussions but fleshing them out yourself would require a lot of patience. So I'm really thankful to Jason Zweig for his commentary of each chapter. He neatly summarizes Graham's main points and makes them much more digestible for us impatient readers. He also updates Graham's analysis with more recent examples - Enron, the dot-com bubble, etc. And he also provides some systematic evidence to Graham's claims (which are often anecdotal).<br/><br/>If you're considering an audio version, pick the one narrated by Luke Daniels.",,,1,0

It's not about training dogs, it's about communicating with dogs: how to read their body language, how we primates misinterpret a lot of what they do, how they misinterpret a lot of what we do. I had no idea that petting a dog on the head or hugging a dog are often perceived as aggression/punishment. It had never occurred to me that if you run after your dog when he grabs the remote he sees that as a fetch game - i.e., as a reward for grabbing the remote. It had never occurred to me that if your dog is running away from you at the park the way to make him come back is to move away from him, not toward him. It all sounds pretty obvious *after* Dr. McConnell explains it, but it's actually a lot of counter-intuitive knowledge. So, this book is not about how to housetrain your dog or how to teach it ""sit"" or ""fetch""; it's about all the foundational knowledge you need to have before you even think about training your dog.

You don't find that sort of advice anymore even in books from other proponents of dominance-based training, like Cesar Millan. Still, the book's core message is one of love and respect for your dog, not one of sadism. The authors are monks who have seen hundreds of irresponsible dog owners neglect basic training and socialization; if the monks err on the side of overdiscipline I give them a pass - harmful as physical punishment may be it's probably less harmful than no discipline whatsoever. And some pages of the book should be required reading for any prospective dog owner:<br/><br/>""When it comes to dog, romanticism abounds! [...] Rin Tin Tin, Lassie, Bullet, Benji, and Big Red are all presented as ideal companions who require no training and are faithfully devoted to attending to their owners' every need. They never have soiling 'accidents', they do not need to be taken out for walks, and they are always obedient. They mind their own business when they are not wanted and are always ready to give love and affection when it is asked of them. What could be easier or more wonderful? [...] Not everyone should have a dog. Because of a variety of circumstances, many people simply do not have the time or ability to care for a puppy or even an adult dog. A pup will take us outside of ourselves and our own little world. Ordinary personal decisions that previously concerned only you or your family will now always have to take into account the presence of the puppy. Free time that was once for yourself alone must now be shared with your pup. How do you feel about that? Caring for a dog is a lot of hard work. Canis familiaris, the pet dog, cannot attend to herself. From the moment of her adoption until the day of her death (which, barring accident or illness, can be fifteen years or more), she is a highly dependent creature who will count on you for all the essentials of canine living: food, water, shelter, exercise, training, and periodic veterinary care. But beyond these, the principal need a puppy has throughout her life is social. She requires an owner who is a companion in the fullest sense of the word. Can you see yourself in such a family role?""",,,1,0

Yes, the book is full of anecdotes, but Cesar uses them as illustrations, not as evidence. It's not about Junior the pit bull or Mr. President the bulldog, it's about the lessons the author has learned from hundreds of dogs throughout the years. The anecdotes make it easier for the reader to relate to the story, that's all.<br/><br/>There are some wishy-washy passages (""dogs are instinctual"", etc), but on the whole I learned a lot from this book. It contains so much counter-intuitive information that I had to pause the reproduction (I had the audio version) every ten minutes or so to take notes and process what I had just heard. Ex.: you don't pick the puppy that comes running into your lap (that's a high energy dog, only suitable for trainers and people with lots of free time and patience); you don't introduce the dog to your whole house on the very first day (he must learn that *you* are the pack leader and owner of the territory); it's better to adopt a ""no talk, no touch, no eye contact"" policy in the first days (it avoids overexciting the dog and teaches him that he must *earn* your affection). <br/><br/>Maybe some of it is hogwash. And I have no idea what the results are *relative* to other training philosophies. But that's a guy who's successfully trained hundreds of dogs whereas I failed miserably with the three dogs I owned as a kid (a Belgian Malinois, a Weimaraner, and a Brazilian Terrier, all of whom deserved better). I'm probably better off following Cesar's advice than doing whatever *feels natural* or whatnot. And that’s probably true for most owners.",,,1,0

The bits that tell the history of causal inference are especially illuminating; I learned a lot of stats in grad school but very little about the struggles and accidents that produced the tools I learned. Pearl helps put much of that into context.<br/><br/>Now, Pearl's intended audience is clearly the machine learning community. Much of what he says will not sound particularly Earth-shattering to people in (or from) the social sciences. ""You can't learn causality from data alone, you need a model!"" is one of the book's core messages. It's hard to see an economist or political scientist disagreeing with it. You come up with a theory, you think up its observable implications, you test them. Even Pearl's proposal that we use mediation analysis won't sound exactly novel. Social scientists have been doing that, they just don't use that name for it (they call it ""testing the theory's microfoundations""). Now, having abandoned political science and lived among the machine learning people for four years now, I can see how Pearl's message is important to his intended audience. And social scientists should read the book too because it intelligently discusses the limitations of tools like RCTs and matching.<br/><br/>In the end what Pearl proposes - that we use our knowledge of how the world works in order to formulate and test hypotheses - may turn out to be (deservedly) influential in the machine learning community, but it won't help fix the core problem with the social sciences, i.e., that social scientists can always twist their hypotheses - not to mention the very questions they ask - to accomodate their pet world views. And when the Democrat/Republican ratio is 6:1, as it is in political science, we can't trust that people will keep each other honest - they won't. Pearl discusses in passing the possibility that some day we may have machine learning algorithms capable of producing their own causal models. Maybe then the social sciences will be worth the money they cost taxpayers.",,,1,0

Then you think it's really over, but no: there is an afterword by Margaret Atwood herself where she subjects us to all sorts of inane social commentary about Trump and whatnot.

You will feel right at home even though the story is set in an alien world (I).<br/><br/>The planet is called Arbre and it has a history and society are not radically different from Earth’s. Except that at some point (thousands of years before the story begins) the people of Arbre revolted against science and confined their intellectuals to monasteries where the development and use of technology is severely limited - no computers, no cell phones, no internet, no cameras, etc -, as is any contact with the outside world. Inside these monasteries (“Maths”) the intellectuals (the “avout”) dedicate themselves to the study and development of mathematics, physics, and philosophy. As the use of technology is restricted, all that research is purely theoretical.<br/><br/>Arbre’s Maths are therefore an allegory for Earth’s universities. How many of our papers and dissertations end up having any (non-academic) impact? Maybe 1% of them? Fewer than that? In (Earth’s) academia the metric of success is usually peer-reviewed publications, not real-world usefulness. Even what we call, say, “applied econometrics” or “applied statistics” is more often than not “applied” only in a limited, strictly academic sense; when you apply econometrics to investigate the effect of economic growth on democracy that is unlikely to have any detectable effect on economic growth or democracy.<br/><br/>So, in Anathem you find this bizarre alien world where intellectuals are physically confined and isolated from the rest of the world and can’t use technology and yet that world feels familiar and as a (current or former) scholar you won’t react to that in the same way other people do. If you go check the reviews on Goodreads you’ll see lots of people complaining that the Maths are unrealistic. To you, however, Maths will sound eerily natural; Anathem would be more alien to you if the Maths were, say, engineering schools.<br/><br/>(Needless to say, the allegory only goes so far, as Arbran’s avout are legally forbidden from having any real-world impact; having no choice in the matter, they don’t lose any sleep over the purely academic nature of their work. And of course people do produce lots of useful research at Earth’s universities.)<br/><br/>2. You will feel right at home even though the story is set in an alien world (II).<br/><br/>The way an Arbran avout progresses in his or her mathic career is entirely different from the way an Earthly scholar progresses in his or her academic career - and yet way too familiar. In Arbre you start by being collected at around age 10. That makes you a “fid” and you will be mentored and taught by the more senior avout, each of which you will respectully address as “pa” or “ma”. When you reach your early twenties you choose - and are chosen by - a specific mathic order. There are many such orders, each named after the avout who founded it - there are the Edharians, the Lorites, the Matharrites, and so on, each with specific liturgies and beliefs.<br/><br/>The avout are not allowed to have any contact with the outside world (the “extramuros”) except at certain regular intervals: one year (the Unarian maths), ten years (the Decenarian maths), one hundred years (the Centenarian maths), or one thousand years (the Milleniarian maths). And only for ten days (those days are called “Apert”). You can get collected by any math - Unarian, Decenarian, Centenarian, or Millenarian. If you get collected, say, at a Unarian math, and you show a lot of skill and promise, you can get upgraded (“Graduated”) to a Decenarian math. If you keep showing skill and promise you can get Graduated to a Centenarian math. And so on. The filter gets progressively stricter; only very few ever get Graduated to the Millenarian maths.<br/><br/>So, the reward for being isolated from the outside world and focusing intensely on your research is… getting even more isolated from the outside world so that you can focus even more intensely on your research. Sounds familiar?<br/><br/>https://twitter.com/academicssay/status/542416581561573378?lang=en<br/><br/>3. Anathem gives you vocabulary for all things academia.<br/><br/>Think back to your Ph.D. years and remember the times you went out with your fellow fids for drinks (well, if you were actual fids you wouldn’t be able to leave your math - you could, but then you wouldn’t be able to go back, except during Apert - but never mind that). Weird conversations (from the point of view of those overhearing them) ensued and you got curious looks from waiters and from other customers.<br/><br/>Why? Because you spoke in the jargon of your field - you used non-ordinary words and you used ordinary words in non-ordinary ways. Like “instrumental” or “endogeneity” or “functional programming”. Not only that: the conversations were speculative and obeyed certain unwritten rules, like Occam’s razor. Clearly these were not the same conversations you have with non-avout - your college friends, your family, your Tinder dates. And yet you call all of them “conversations”. Well, not anymore; Anathem gives you a word for inter-avout conversation about mathic subjects: Dialog. Neal Stephenson goes as far as creating a taxonomy of Dialog types:<br/><br/>""Dialog, Peregrin: A Dialog in which two participants of roughly equal knowledge and intelligence develop an idea by talking to each other, typically while out walking around. <br/>Dialog, Periklynian: A competitive Dialog in which each participant seeks to destroy the other’s position (see Plane). <br/>Dialog, Suvinian: A Dialog in which a mentor instructs a fid, usually by asking the fid questions, as opposed to speaking discursively. <br/>Dialog: A discourse, usually in formal style, between theors. “To be in Dialog” is to participate in such a discussion extemporaneously. The term may also apply to a written record of a historical Dialog; such documents are the cornerstone of the mathic literary tradition and are studied, re-enacted, and memorized by fids. In the classic format, a Dialog involves two principals and some number of onlookers who participate sporadically. Another common format is the Triangular, featuring a savant, an ordinary person who seeks knowledge, and an imbecile. There are countless other classifications, including the suvinian, the Periklynian, and the peregrin.<br/>(Anathem, pp. 960-961)<br/><br/>(Yes, there is a glossary in Anathem.)<br/><br/>You can’t get much more precise than that without being summoned to a Millenarian math.<br/><br/>Dialog is just one example. You left academia? You went Feral.<br/><br/>Feral: A literate and theorically minded person who dwells in the Sæculum, cut off from contact with the mathic world. Typically an ex-avout who has renounced his or her vows or been Thrown Back, though the term is also technically applicable to autodidacts who have never been avout.<br/>(Anathem, p. 963)<br/><br/>You left academia to go work for the government? You got Evoked.<br/><br/>Voco: A rarely celebrated aut by which the Sæcular Power Evokes (calls forth from the math) an avout whose talents are needed in the Sæcular world. Except in very unusual cases, the one Evoked never returns to the mathic world.<br/>(Anathem, p. 976)<br/><br/>Reviewer #2 says your argument is not original? He’s a Lorite.<br/><br/>Lorite: A member of an Order founded by Saunt Lora, who believed that all of the ideas that the human mind was capable of coming up with had already been come up with. Lorites are, therefore, historians of thought who assist other avout in their work by making them aware of others who have thought similar things in the past, and thereby preventing them from re-inventing the wheel.<br/>(Anathem, p. 967)<br/><br/>Got friends or family who are not academics? Well, ok, J. K. Rowling has already given us a word for that - muggles. But in some languages that word gets super offensive translations - in Brazilian Portuguese, for instance, they made it “trouxas”, which means “idiots”. Not cool, Harry Potter translators. But worry not, Neal Stephenson gives us an alternative that’s only a tiny bit offensive: “extras” (from “extramuros” - everything outside the maths).<br/><br/>Extra: Slightly disparaging term used by avout to refer to Sæcular people.<br/>(Anathem, p. 963)<br/><br/>That cousin of yours who believes the Earth is flat? He is a sline.<br/><br/>Sline: An extramuros person with no special education, skills, aspirations, or hope of acquiring same, generally construed as belonging to the lowest social class.<br/>(Anathem, p. 973)<br/><br/>And of course, what happens to a scholar who gets expelled from academia? He gets anathametized.<br/><br/>Anathem: (1) In Proto-Orth, a poetic or musical invocation of Our Mother Hylaea, used in the aut of Provener, or (2) an aut by which an incorrigible fraa or suur is ejected from the mathic world.<br/>(Anathem, pp. 956-957)<br/><br/>And so on and so forth. Frankly, it’s amazing that academics manage to have any Dialogs whatsoever without having read Anathem.<br/><br/>(I must note that Neal Stephenson not only puts these words in the book’s glossary, he uses them extensively throughout the book - there are 40 occurrences of “evoked”, 90 occurrences of “Dialog”, and 57 occurrences of “sline”, for instance. And because there is a glossary at the end he doesn’t bother to define these words in the main text, he just uses them. Which can make your life difficult if, like me, you didn’t bother to skim the book before reading it and only found out about the glossary after you had finished. Damn Kindle.)<br/><br/>4. Anathem might be the push you need to quit social media for good.<br/><br/>I’ve been reading Cal Newport’s Deep Work, about the importance of focusing hard and getting “in the zone” in order to be productive. (Well, “reading” is inaccurate. I bought the audio version and I’ve been listening to it while driving - which is not without irony.) There isn’t a whole lot of novelty there - it’s mostly common sense advice about “unplugging” for at least a couple of hours each day so you can get meaningful work done (meaningful work being work that imposes some mental strain, as opposed to replying emails or attending meetings). The thing is, at a certain point, much to my amusement and surprise, Cal Newport mentions Neal Stephenson.<br/><br/>As Cal Newport tells us, Neal Stephenson is a known recluse. He doesn’t answer emails and he is absent from social media. To Newport, that helps explain Stephenson’s productivity and success (No, I won’t engage you in a long Periklynian Dialog about how we can’t establish causality based on anecdotal evidence. That’s not the point and in any case Cal Newport, despite being an avout himself - he’s a computer science professor at Georgetown - is trying to reach an audience of extras and Ferals.) I had read other Neal Stephenson books before - Cryptonomicon, Snow Crash, The Diamond Age, REAMDE, Seveneves -, but I had never bothered to google the man, so I had no idea how he lived. After Cal Newport’s mention, though, I think Anathem is a lot more personal than it looks. Among its many messages maybe there is Neal Stephenson telling us “see? this is what can be achieved when smart people are locked up and cut off from the world”. “What can be achieved” being, in Neal Stephenson’s case (and brilliantly recursively), a great novel about what can be achieved when smart people are locked up and cut off from access to the world.<br/><br/>5. Anathem may be an extreme version of what happens when people turn against science.<br/><br/>Flat-Earthers and anti-vaxxers are back and people who don’t know what a standard-deviation is pontificate freely and publicly about the scientific evidence of climate change. I’m not saying these slines are about to lock up Earth’s scientists in monasteries, but perhaps the Temnestrian Iconography is getting more popular.<br/><br/>""“[...] Fid Erasmas, what are the Iconographies and why do we concern ourselves with them?” <br/>[...] <br/>“Well, the extras—” <br/>“The Sæculars,” Tamura corrected me. <br/>“The Sæculars know that we exist. They don’t know quite what to make of us. The truth is too complicated for them to keep in their heads. Instead of the truth, they have simplified representations— caricatures— of us. Those come and go, and have done since the days of Thelenes. But if you stand back and look at them, you see certain patterns that recur again and again, like, like— attractors in a chaotic system.” <br/>“Spare me the poetry,” said Grandsuur Tamura with a roll of the eyes. There was a lot of tittering, and I had to force myself not to glance in Tulia’s direction. <br/>I went on, “Well, long ago those patterns were identified and written down in a systematic way by avout who make a study of extramuros. They are called Iconographies. They are important because if we know which iconography a given extra— pardon me, a given Sæcular— is carrying around in his head, we’ll have a good idea what they think of us and how they might react to us.” <br/>Grandsuur Tamura gave no sign of whether she liked my answer or not. But she turned her eyes away from me, which was the most I could hope for. “Fid Ostabon,” she said, staring now at a twenty-one-year-old fraa with a ragged beard. “What is the Temnestrian Iconography?” <br/>“It is the oldest,” he began. “I didn’t ask how old it was.” “It’s from an ancient comedy,” he tried. <br/>“I didn’t ask where it was from.” <br/>“The Temnestrian Iconography…” he rebegan. <br/>“I know what it’s called. *What is it?*” <br/>“It depicts us as clowns,” Fraa Ostabon said, a little brusquely. “But… clowns with a sinister aspect. It is a two-phase iconography: at the beginning, we are shown, say, prancing around with butterfly nets or looking at shapes in the clouds…” <br/>“Talking to spiders,” someone put in. Then, when no reprimand came from Grandsuur Tamura, someone else said: “Reading books upside-down.” Another: “Putting our urine up in test tubes.” <br/>“So at first it seems only comical,” said Fraa Ostabon, regaining the floor. “But then in the second phase, a dark side is shown— an impressionable youngster is seduced, a responsible mother lured into insanity, a political leader led into decisions that are pure folly.” <br/>“It’s a way of blaming the degeneracy of society on us— making us the original degenerates,” said Grandsuur Tamura. “Its origins? Fid Dulien?” <br/>“The Cloud-weaver, a satirical play by the Ethran playwright Temnestra that mocks Thelenes by name and that was used as evidence in his trial.” <br/>“How to know if someone you meet is a subscriber to this iconography? Fid Olph?” <br/>“Probably they will be civil as long as the conversation is limited to what they understand, but they’ll become strangely hostile if we begin speaking of abstractions…?”""<br/><br/>(Anathem, pp. 71-72)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>This is it. Go read Anathem and tell your fellow avout and Ferals about it. See you at Apert.",,,1,0
