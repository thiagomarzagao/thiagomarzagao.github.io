Hi! I’m Thiago Marzagão and I do data analysis for academic, policy-making, and hedonistic purposes. I got my Ph.D. at the Ohio State University, where I mined news articles to create a [machine-coded democracy index](http://bibliotecadigital.fgv.br/ojs/index.php/bre/article/view/58160) (I was funded by the [Fulbright Commission](https://fulbright.org.br/) and by the Brazilian government), and now I work for the [Observatory of Public Spending](http://www.cgu.gov.br/assuntos/informacoes-estrategicas/observatorio-da-despesa-publica) (a division of the Comptroller General of Brazil), where I use machine learning to fight corruption.

I have worked for the Brazilian antitrust agency ([CADE](http://cade.gov.br/)), where I built CÉREBRO - an app that detects bid-rigging in public procurement. I also teach at Brasília universities and research institutes, off and on - I have taught statistics at [IDP](/teaching/estatistica/) and machine learning at [UnB](/teaching/mineracao/), [IPEA](http://thiagomarzagao.com/teaching/ipea/), and [IESB](http://thiagomarzagao.com/teaching/iesb1/).

You can find more details about my work in my [papers](http://thiagomarzagao.com/publications/), [talks](http://thiagomarzagao.com/talks%20&%20slides/), [code](http://thiagomarzagao.com/code/), and [résumé](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thiagomarzagao/resume_ThiagoMarzagao.pdf).

I also play with LEGO robots (I've made a [Python module](https://github.com/thiagomarzagao/ev3py) that makes it easy to program LEGO Mindstorms EV3 bricks), write tutorials ("[webscraping with Selenium](http://thiagomarzagao.com/2013/11/12/webscraping-with-selenium-part-1/)" is by far the most popular one), [discuss Brazilian music](http://thiagomarzagao.com/2015/12/24/text-analyzing-brazilian-music/), listen to podcasts (check [The History of English Podcast](http://historyofenglishpodcast.com/) and [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/)), read sci-fi (here's my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45921922-thiago-marzag-o)), watch Rick and Morty, and waste time on social media.

Here's a picture of my dog (unlike me she is on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aryavonkempten/); before getting her I read a lot about dogs - [here](https://twitter.com/tmarzagao/status/1014685028155052032)'s what I learned):
