I got my Ph.D. at the Ohio State University, where I mined news articles to create a [machine-coded democracy index](http://bibliotecadigital.fgv.br/ojs/index.php/bre/article/view/58160) (I was funded by the [Fulbright Commission](https://fulbright.org.br/) and by the Brazilian government), and now I lead the data science team at [Fitbod](https://fitbod.me/), an amazing app that creates personalized workouts based on your fitness goal and available equipment.

I have worked for the Brazilian government, where I used machine learning to find corruption and bid-rigging and to automate processes. I also do some research and [publish](/publications) on peer-reviewed economic/econometrics journals, and I have [taught](/publications) graduate and undergraduate courses on everything from basic statistics to deep learning. You can find more details about my work in my [talks](/talks%20&%20slides/), [code](/code/), and [résumé](/assets/resume.pdf).

I also play with LEGO robots (I've made a [Python module](https://github.com/thiagomarzagao/ev3py) that makes it easy to program LEGO Mindstorms EV3 bricks), write tutorials ("[webscraping with Selenium](/2013/11/12/webscraping-with-selenium-part-1/)" is by far the most popular one), read sci-fi (here's my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45921922-thiago-marzag-o)), bike and run around São Paulo.
